Tesla is in early discussions to license its Full Self-Driving (FSD)
technology to another major automaker that has not been named. Elon
Musk says that licensing the software has always been part of the
plan. Tesla's FSD works on local roads with traffic signals,
intersections, and vulnerable road users. It requires drivers to pay
attention to the road and take control of the vehicle when asked.
There are currently 16 crashes by Tesla vehicles using Autopilot being
investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,
out of which only one caused a fatality. ",1

Getting hearing aids could cut the risk of cognitive decline in half.
Cognitive decline and dementia have become a growing problem as people
are living longer. Hearing loss is one of the biggest risk factors for
developing dementia. There are several reasons why hearing loss might
contribute to cognitive decline, such as the brain having to work
harder to decode audio signals, brain atrophy, or a lack of social
activity.",1

A paper published by researchers from Stanford University and the
University of California shows that GPT-4's outputs have declined in
quality over the past few months. While some experts aren't convinced
by the paper, the lack of certainty around whether GPT-4's quality has
declined points to a larger issue with how OpenAI handles its model
releases. Popular theories about GPT-4's decline in performance
include OpenAI reducing computational overhead, unintended effects
from fine-tuning, and OpenAI reducing its abilities so more people
will pay GitHub Copilot. OpenAI has consistently declined any claims
that its models have decreased in capability. ",1

This article presents an in-depth analysis on why Meta made Llama 2's
weights commercially available. Llama 2's license provides hints to
Meta's goals - it prevents Llama Materials from being used to improve
other models, competitors with more than 700 million monthly active
users must request a license from Meta, and there are no trademark
licenses. This suggests Llama 2 was open-sourced to reduce competitor
moats, to attract more users and developers, and as a marketing tool. ",1

OpenAI has curtailed public access to GPT-4's image-recognition
abilities as it can potentially recognize specific individuals. The
feature could potentially infringe upon privacy laws in regions where
the use of biometric information requires explicit consent from users.
It could also misrepresent aspects of people's faces, leading to
inappropriate or harmful results. There have been instances of the
model hallucinating responses, giving users inaccurate information.
Microsoft has been testing a limited rollout of the visual analysis
tool in its Bing chatbot. ",1

An anesthetist  renowned for their ability to spot dodgy data in
medical trials estimates that 44% of trials contain at least some
flawed data and that 26% of papers have flaws  so large that the
studies can't be trusted. These studies resemble real research, but
close scrutiny will show that the authors were incompetent or that the
data was faked. Without access to raw trial data, even experienced
investigators may miss hidden flaws. Journals need to assume that all
submitted papers are potentially flawed and review the data before
publishing them. ",1

Scientists have used two different gene therapy strategies to reverse
the effects of a gene known to cause Pitt Hopkins syndrome. Pitt
Hopkins syndrome is a complex condition classed in the autism spectrum

a gene called transcription factor 4 (TCF4). TCF4 is important to
brain development, but scientists know little about its mechanisms.
The research was conducted on organoids and it will be a long while

AlphaCode is an AI system by DeepMind that can write computer programs
at a competitive level. The research on AlphaCode is still in its
early stages, but it was able to achieve a rank that placed it within
the top 54% of human coders when tested against challenges on a
competitive coding platform. While the challenges were not
representative of the real-world challenges that developers face,
AlphaCode's abilities could lead to tools that could make programming
more accessible. AI coding systems are still far from ready to take
over the work of human programmers as the code they produce is often
buggy and can contain copyrighted material due to the way they are

Scientists from MIT have developed a scalable production method that

Using the method, the team developed a material called 2DPA-1. 2DPA-1

twice that of steel. It can take six times more force than bulletproof
glass and it is completely impermeable to gases and liquids. The

Scientists from Japan have successfully manipulated mice memories
using a neural-optic system. The experiment involved putting mice in a
dark chamber that gave them electric shocks to make them anxious
around the chamber. Mice that received the treatment forgot about the

illuminating certain neurons to inhibit a protein essential to
consolidating memory during sleep. The technology provides a method
for isolating memory formation and could lead to a range of treatments

The bots can also reproduce through kinetic replication. They can

Researchers used artificial intelligence to design xenobots that were
more effective at this type of replication, which resulted in a design
that resembled Pac-Man. Xenobots are still an early technology, but
they have a host of potential uses, including collecting microplastics

Flow batteries are a promising technology for making solar and wind
power a regular part of the grid. They could theoretically be scaled
up to megawatt-hours by increasing their tank size. Flow batteries
have longer lifetimes and are safer than lithium-ion batteries.
However, their capital cost is more than twice that of lithium-ion
batteries, making them expensive. Researchers have managed to reduce
the size of a flow battery cell by 75 percent by replacing flat
electrodes and membranes with wire electrodes and tubular membranes.
The new design could decrease the cost of flow-battery power modules
by around half.",0

Intel is looking to system technology co-optimization (STCO) as the
next biggest step to continuing Moore's law. STCO is an outside-in

support, then works down to system architecture, the type of silicon
used, and then the semiconductor manufacturing process. The process is
designed to create optimized systems that best fit the end product.
STCO is now an option in a large part as chiplets can be easily
